About

Danielle discovered her "Inner I" out of the depths of discomfort. Her sense of safety had been shaken in the world she called home; her closest friends were far away in Prague, London, Chicago, and California; she was ready to step into a relationship where there was no one there to meet her; and she had barely received her degree when she jumped into a new and painfully challenging career path. She felt lost, and untethered. 

Alone. 

Alone in one of the most densely-populated cities in the world. During that dreary New York City winter, Danielle found meditation (and kickboxing!). She learned how to lean in, <em>when things fall apart</em>, thanks to a student also in distress who introduced her to Pema Chodron's teachings. In that darkness, Danielle met a light. A lamppost that helped guide her back to her Self by sharing resources, programs, and tools that set her on the path of Self-exploration, intuitive listening, and personal freedom. Without that period of discomfort, uncertainty, and darkness, Danielle might still be waiting -- waiting for that perfect thing to fall apart -- to awaken her Inner i.

Danielle's mission is to use her journey as your toolkit. You don't have to wait until things fall apart. And if it feels like they already have, you are exactly where you need to be.
